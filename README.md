# hi, i’m amanda 👋  
**product-minded developer | brunch enthusiast | cs @ queen’s**

---

i’m a third-year computer science student at queen’s university with a love for building products that are thoughtful, useful, and a little bit fun.

with experience across product design, development, and marketing, i’ve led multidisciplinary teams, built full-stack apps, and pitched winning ideas at competitions like QTMA x McKinsey. whether it’s launching a campus UX club or refining listing flows at a proptech startup, i thrive at the intersection of creativity, strategy, and execution.

currently designing tools for students @ [Nucleus](https://github.com), building [Queen’s UX Club](https://www.instagram.com/queensuxclub), and always down to chat about design systems, product growth, or your favorite café’s loyalty program.
